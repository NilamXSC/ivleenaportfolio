```txt
1. Framework Choice
   - This is a Vite + React project, NOT Next.js.

2. Font Loading (Critical)
   - Google Fonts are loaded via <link> tags in index.html.

3. Tailwind Configuration
   - Tailwind content paths are intentionally strict.

4. Case-Sensitive Imports
   - The project is deployed on Linux-based environments.

5. Client Context
   - Design decisions prioritize clarity, authority,
     and professionalism over experimental UI.
   - Animations are subtle by design and should not
     be exaggerated when extending the project.
